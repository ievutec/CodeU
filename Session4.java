// I decided to simplify the task by not using trailing zeros, although
// if I have time I'll modify the original to configure to trailing zeros.

// If there is a way to make the function faster, I think I would create an
// array to keep track of the integers I already know are pallindromes and configure
// the size of the array to whatever is appropriate for its usage.
